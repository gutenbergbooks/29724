<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This book has been prepared with the idea that teachers generally would
be glad to introduce into their classes work dealing with the real
objects of nature, provided the work chosen were of a character that
would admit of its being studied at all seasons and in all localities,
and that the subject were one of general interest, and one that could be
taught successfully by those who have had no regular scientific
instruction.</p>

<p>The trees of our forests, lawns, yards, orchards, streets, borders, and
parks give us just such a department. Though many consider a large part
of the vegetable kingdom of little importance, and unworthy of any
serious study, there are few who do not admire, and fewer still who do
not desire to know, our trees, the monarchs of all living things.</p>

<p>The difficulty in tree study by the aid of the usual botanies lies
mainly in the fact that in using them the first essential parts to be
examined are the blossoms and their organs. These remain on the trees a
very short time, are often entirely unnoticed on account of their small
size or obscure color, and are usually inaccessible even if seen. In
this book the leaves, the wood, the bark, and, in an elementary way, the
fruit are the parts to which the attention is directed; these all can be
found and studied throughout the greater part of the year, and are just
the parts that must be thoroughly known by all who wish to learn to
recognize trees.</p>

<p>Though every teacher is at liberty to use the book as he thinks best,
the author, who has been a class teacher for over twenty years, is of
the opinion that but little of Part I. need be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> thoroughly studied and
recited, with the exception of Chapter III. on leaves. The object of
this chapter is not to have the definitions recited (the recitation of
definitions in school work is often useless or worse than useless), but
to teach the pupil to use the terms properly and to make them a portion
of his vocabulary. The figures on <a href="#Page_38">pages 38</a>-43 are designed for class
description, and for the application of botanical words. The first time
the chapter is studied the figure illustrating the term should be
pointed out by the pupil; then, as a review of the whole chapter, the
student should be required to give a full description of each leaf.</p>

<p>After this work with Chapter III., and the careful reading of the whole
of Part I., the pupils can begin the description of trees, and, as the
botanical words are needed, search can be made for them under the proper
heads or in the Glossary.</p>

<p>The Keys are for the use of those who know nothing of scientific botany.
The advanced botanist may think them too artificial and easy; but let
him remember that this work was written for the average teacher who has
had no strictly scientific training. We can hardly expect that the great
majority of people will ever become scientific in any line, but it is
possible for nearly every one to become interested in and fully
acquainted with the trees of his neighborhood.</p>

<p>The attainment of such botanical knowledge by the plan given in this
volume will not only accomplish this useful purpose, but will do what is
worth far more to the student, <i>i.e.</i>, teach him to employ his own
senses in the investigation of natural objects, and to use his own
powers of language in their description.</p>

<p>With hardly an exception, the illustrations in the work are taken from
original drawings from nature by the author. A few of the scales of
pine-cones were copied from London's "Encyclopædia of Trees"; some of
the Retinospora cones were taken from the "Gardener's Chronicle"; and
three of the illustrations in Part I. are from Professor Gray's works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The size of the illustration as compared with the specimen of plant is
indicated by a fraction near it; ¼ indicates that the drawing is one
fourth as long as the original, 1/1 that it is natural size, etc. The
notching of the margin is reduced to the same extent; so a margin which
in the engraving looks about entire, might in the leaf be quite
distinctly serrate. The only cases in which the scale is not given are
in the cross-sections of the leaves among the figures of coniferous
plants. These are uniformly three times the natural size, except the
section of Araucaria imbricata, which is not increased in scale.</p>

<p>The author has drawn from every available source of information, and in
the description of many of the species no attempt whatever has been made
to change the excellent wording of such authors as Gray, Loudon, etc.</p>

<p>The ground covered by the book is that of the wild and cultivated trees
found east of the Rocky Mountains, and north of the southern boundary of
Virginia and Missouri. It contains not only the native species, but all
those that are successfully cultivated in the whole region; thus
including all the species of Ontario, Quebec, etc., on the north, and
many species, both wild and cultivated, of the Southern States and the
Pacific coast. In fact, the work will be found to contain so large a
proportion of the trees of the Southern States as to make it very useful
in the schools of that section.</p>

<p>Many shrubby plants are introduced; some because they occasionally grow
quite tree-like, others because they can readily be trimmed into
tree-forms, others because they grow very tall, and still others because
they are trees in the Southern States.</p>

<p>In nomenclature a conservative course has been adopted. The most
extensively used text-book on the subject of Botany, "Gray's Manual,"
has recently been rewritten. That work includes every species, native
and naturalized, of the region covered by this book, and the names as
given in that edition have been used in all cases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Scientific names are marked so as to indicate the pronunciation. The
vowel of the accented syllable is marked by the grave accent (`) if
long, and by the acute (´) if short.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this book the author has received much valuable
aid. His thanks are especially due to the authorities of the Arnold
Arboretum, Boston, Massachusetts, and of the Missouri Botanical Garden,
St. Louis, for information in regard to the hardiness of species; to Mr.
John H. Redfield, of the Botanical Department of the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences, for books, specimens from which to make
illustrations, etc.; and to Dr. A. C. Stokes, of Trenton, New Jersey,
for assistance in many ways, but especially for the accurate manner in
which he has inked the illustrations from the author's pencil-drawings.</p>

<p>The author also wishes to acknowledge the help received from many
nurserymen in gathering specimens for illustration and in giving
information of great value. Among these, special thanks are due to Mr.
Samuel C. Moon, of Morrisville Nurseries, who placed his large
collection of living specimens at the author's disposal, and in many
other ways gave him much intelligent aid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<i>Roots.</i></h3>


<p>Though but little study of the roots of trees is practicable, some
knowledge of their forms, varieties, and parts is important.</p>

<p>The great office of the roots of all plants is the taking in of food
from the soil. Thick or fleshy roots, such as the radish, are stocks of
food prepared for the future growth of the plant, or for the production
of flowers and fruit. The thick roots of trees are designed mainly for
their secure fastening in the soil. The real mouths by which the food is
taken in are the minute tips of the hair-like roots found over the
surface of the smaller branches. As trees especially need a strong
support, they all have either a <i>tap-root</i>&mdash;one large root extending
from the lower end of the trunk deep down into the ground; or <i>multiple
roots</i>&mdash;a number of large roots mainly extending outward from the base
of the trunk.</p>

<p>Trees with large tap-roots are very hard to transplant, and cannot with
safety be transferred after they have attained any real size. The
Hickories and Oaks belong to this class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Trees having multiple roots are readily transplanted, even when large.
The Maples and Elms are of this class.</p>

<p>Roots that grow from the root-end of the embryo of the seed are called
<i>primary roots</i>; those growing from slips or from stems anywhere are
<i>secondary roots</i>.</p>

<p>Some trees grow luxuriantly with only secondary roots; such trees can
readily be raised from stems placed in the ground. The Willows and
Poplars are good examples of this group. Other trees need all the
strength that primary roots can give them; these have to be raised from
seed. Peach-trees are specially good examples, but practically most
trees are best raised from seed.</p>

<p>A few trees can be easily raised from root-cuttings or from suckers
which grow up from roots. The Ailanthus, or "Tree of Heaven," is best
raised in this way. Of this tree there are three kinds, two of which
have disagreeable odors when in bloom, but the other is nearly odorless.
By using the roots or the suckers of the third kind, only those which
would be pleasant to have in a neighborhood would be obtained. One of
the large cities of the United States has in its streets thousands of
the most displeasing of these varieties and but few of the right sort,
all because the nurseryman who originally supplied the city used
root-cuttings from the disagreeable kind.</p>

<p>If such trees were raised from the seed, only about one third would be
desirable, and their character could be determined only when they had
reached such a size as to produce fruit, when it would be too late to
transplant them. Fruit-trees, when raised from the seed, have to be
grafted with the desired variety in order to secure good fruit when they
reach the bearing age.</p>

<i>Stems and Branches.</i></h3>


<p>The stem is the distinguishing characteristic of trees, separating them
from all other groups of plants. Although in the region covered by this
book the trees include all the very large plants, size alone does not
make a tree.</p>

<p>A plant with a single trunk of woody structure that does not branch for
some distance above the ground, is called a <i>tree</i>. Woody plants that
branch directly above the soil, even though they grow to the height of
twenty feet or more, are called <i>shrubs</i>, or, in popular language,
<i>bushes</i>. Many plants which have a tendency to grow into the form of
shrubs may, by pruning, be forced to grow tree-like; some that are
shrubs in the northern States are trees further south.</p>

<p>All the trees that grow wild, or can be cultivated out of doors, in the
northern States belong to one class, the stems having a separable bark
on the outside, a minute stem of pith in the center, and, between these,
wood in annual layers. Such a stem is called <i>exogenous</i>
(outside-growing), because a new layer forms on the outside of the wood
each year.</p>

    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Another kind of tree-stem is found abundantly in the tropics; one, the
Palmetto, grows from South Carolina to Florida. While in our region
there are no trees of this character, there are plants having this kind
of stem, the best illustration being the corn-stalk. In this case there
is no separable bark, and the woody substance is in threads within the
pithy material. In the corn-stalk the woody threads are not very
numerous, and the pith is very abundant; in most of the tropical trees
belonging to this group the threads of wood are so numerous as to make
the ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>terial very durable and fit for furniture. A stem of this kind is
called <i>endogenous</i> (inside-growing). <a href="#i012a">Fig. 1</a> represents a longitudinal
and a cross section of an exogenous stem, and <a href="#i012b">Fig. 2</a> of an endogenous
one.</p>

        title="Fig. 2." />
    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Since all the stems with which we have to deal are exogens, a particular
description of that class will here be given. <a href="#i012a">Fig. 1</a> shows the
appearance of a section of an Ash stem six years old. The central
portion, which is about as thick as wrapping-twine, is the <i>pith</i>; from
this outward toward the bark can be seen the six annual layers of the
<i>wood</i>; and then comes the <i>bark</i>, consisting of two portions. First
there is an inside layer of greenish material, the fresh-growing
portion, and lastly the outer or dead matter. This outer portion must
crack open, peel off, or in some way give a chance for the constant
growth of the trunk. The different kinds of trees are readily known by
the appearance of the bark of the trunk, due to the many varieties of
surface caused by the allowance for growth. None of the characteristics
of trees afford a better opportunity for careful observation and study
than the outer bark.</p>

<p>The Birches have bark that peels off in thin horizontal layers&mdash;the
color, thinness, and toughness differing in the different species; the
Ashes have bark which opens in many irregular, netted cracks moderately
near each other; the bark of the Chestnut opens in large longitudinal
cracks quite distant from one another. The color of the bark and the
character of the scales are quite different in the White and the Black
Oaks.</p>

<p>In the woody portion radiating lines may be seen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> these are the <i>silver
grain</i>; they are called by the botanist <i>medullary rays</i>.</p>

<p>The central portion of the wood of many large stems is darker in color
than the rest. This darker portion is dead wood, and is called
<i>heart-wood</i>; the outer portion, called <i>sap-wood</i>, is used in carrying
the sap during the growing season. The heart-wood of the Walnut-tree is
very dark brown; that of the Cherry, light red; and that of the Holly,
white and ivory-like. The heart-wood is the valuable part for lumber.</p>

<p>If examined under a magnifying glass, the <i>annual layers</i> will be seen
to consist of minute tubes or cells. In most trees these tubes are much
larger in the portion that grew early in the season, while the wood
seems almost solid near the close of the annual layer; this is
especially true in the Ashes and the Chestnut; some trees, however, show
but little change in the size of the cells, the Beech being a good
example. In a cross-section, the age of such trees as the Chestnut can
readily be estimated, while in the Beech it is quite difficult to do
this. Boxwood, changing least in the character of its structure, is the
one always used for first-grade wood-engravings.</p>

<p>When wood is cut in the direction of the silver grain, or cut
"quartering" as it is called by the lumbermen, the surface shows this
cellular material spread out in strange blotches characteristic of the
different kinds of wood. <a href="#i035">Fig. 16</a> shows an Oak where the blotches of
medullary rays are large. In the Beech the blotches are smaller; in the
Elm quite small. Lumber cut carefully in this way is said to be
"quartered," and with most species its beauty is thereby much increased.</p>

<p>Any one who studies the matter carefully can become acquainted with all
the useful and ornamental woods used in a region; the differences in the
color of the heart-wood, the character of the annual layers, and the
size and the distribution of the medullary rays, afford enough
peculiarities to distinguish any one from all others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Branching.</span>&mdash;The regular place from which a branch grows is the <i>axil</i> of
a leaf, from what is called an <i>axillary bud</i>; but branches cannot grow
in the axils of all leaves. A tree with opposite leaves occasionally has
opposite branches; while a tree with alternate leaves has all its
branches alternate.</p>

<p>Most branches continue their growth year after year by the development
of a bud at the end, called a <i>terminal bud</i>. Many trees form this bud
for the next year's growth so early in the year that it is seldom or
never killed by the winter weather; such trees grow very regularly and
are symmetrical in form. Most evergreens are good examples. <a href="#i014">Fig. 3</a>
represents a good specimen. The age of such trees, if not too great, can
be readily ascertained by the regularity of each year's growth. The tree
represented is sixteen years old. The branches that started the fifth
year, about the age at which regular growth begins, are shown by their
scars on the trunk.</p>

<p>The terminal buds of many trees are frequently killed by the frosts of
winter; such trees continue their growth by the development of axillary
buds; but as growth from an axillary bud instead of a terminal one will
make a branch crooked, such trees are irregular in their branching and
outline. Just which axillary buds are most apt to grow depends upon the
kind of tree, but trees of the same variety are nearly uniform in this
respect. Most trees are therefore readily recognized by the form of
outline and the characteristic branching. A good example of a tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> of
very irregular growth is the Catalpa (Indian Bean), shown in <a href="#i015">Fig. 4.</a> The
tendency to grow irregularly usually increases with age. The Buttonwood,
for example, grows quite regularly until it reaches the age of thirty to
forty years; then its new branches grow in peculiarly irregular ways.
The twigs of a very old and a young Apple-tree illustrate this change
which age produces.</p>

<p>There are great differences in the color and surface of the bark of the
twigs of different species of trees; some are green (Sassafras), some
red (Peach, on the sunny side), some purple (Cherry). Some are smooth
and dotless, some marked with dots (Birch), some roughened with corky
ridges (Sweet Gum), etc.</p>

<p>The taste and odor of the bark are characteristics worthy of notice: the
strong, fragrant odor of the Spice-bush; the fetid odor of the Papaw;
the aromatic taste of the Sweet Birch; the bitter taste of the Peach;
the mucilaginous Slippery Elm; the strong-scented, resinous, aromatic
Walnut, etc.</p>

<p>The branches of trees vary greatly in the thickness of their tips and in
their tendency to grow erect, horizontal, or drooping. Thus the delicate
spray of the Birches contrasted with the stout twigs of the Ailanthus,
or the drooping twigs of the Weeping Willow with the erect growth of the
Lombardy Poplar, give contrasts of the strongest character. In the same
way, the directions the main branches take in their growth from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
trunk form another distinctive feature. Thus the upward sloping branches
of the Elm form a striking contrast to the horizontal or downward
sloping branches of the Sour Gum, or, better still, to certain varieties
of Oaks.</p>

<p>When the main trunk of a tree extends upward through the head to the
tip, as in <a href="#i014">Fig. 3</a>, it is said to be <i>excurrent</i>. When it is soon lost in
the division, as in <a href="#i015">Fig. 4</a>, it is said to be <i>deliquescent</i>.</p>

<i>Leaves.</i></h3>


<p>Leaves are the lungs of plants. The food taken in by the roots has to
pass through the stem to the leaves to be acted upon by the air, before
it becomes sap and is fit to be used for the growth of the plant. No
portion of a plant is more varied in parts, forms, surface, and duration
than the leaf.</p>

<p>No one can become familiar with leaves, and appreciate their beauty and
variety, who does not study them upon the plants themselves. This
chapter therefore will be devoted mainly to the words needed for leaf
description, together with their application.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Leaf.</span>&mdash;In the axil of the whole leaf the bud forms for the growth of
a new branch. So by noting the position of the buds, all the parts
included in a single leaf can be determined. As a general thing the leaf
has but one blade, as in the Chestnut, Apple, Elm, etc.; yet the
Horse-chestnut has 7 blades, the Common Locust often has 21, and a
single leaf of the Honey-locust occasionally has as many as 300. Figs.
17-58 (<a href="#c7">Chapter VII.</a>) are all illustrations of single leaves, except <a href="#i040">Fig.
43</a>, where there are two leaves on a twig. A number of them show the bud
by which the fact is determined (Figs. <a href="#i038">25</a>, <a href="#i039">26, 31, 33, 34</a>, <a href="#i040">36, 40</a>,
etc.); others show branches which grew from the axillary buds, many of
them fruiting branches (Figs. <a href="#i040">37, 42, 43</a>, <a href="#i041">50</a>, and <a href="#i042">54</a>), one (<a href="#i041">Fig. 51</a>) a
thorny branch.</p>

<p>The cone-bearing plants (Figs. <a href="#i042">59</a>-67) have only simple leaves. Each
piece, no matter how small and scale-like, may have a branch growing
from its axil, and so may form a whole leaf. A study of these figures,
together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> with the observation of trees, will soon teach the student
what constitutes a leaf.</p>

    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Arrangement.</span>&mdash;There are several different ways in which leaves are
arranged on trees; the most common plan is the <a href="images/illus018a.png"><i>alternate</i></a>;
in this only one leaf occurs at a joint or node on the
stem. The next in frequency is the <a href="images/illus018b.png"><i>opposite</i></a>, where two
leaves opposite each other are found at the node. A very rare
arrangement among trees, though common in other plants, is the
<a href="images/illus018c.png"><i>whorled</i></a>, where more than two leaves, regularly arranged
around the stem, are found at the node. When a number of leaves are
bundled together,&mdash;a plan not rare among evergreens,&mdash;they are said to
be <i>fasciculated</i> or in <a href="images/illus018d.png"><i>fascicles</i></a>. The term <i>scattered</i>
is used where alternate leaves are crowded on the stem. This plan is
also common among evergreens.</p>

    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Caution.</span>&mdash;In some plants the leaves on the side shoots or spurs of a
twig are so close together, the internodes being so short, that at first
sight they seem opposite. In such cases, the leaf-scars of the preceding
years, or the arrangement of the branches, is a better test of the true
arrangement of the leaves. The twig of Birch shown in <a href="#i018e">Fig. 5</a> has
alternate leaves.</p>

<div class="floatr" style="width: 200px;" id="i019b">

        title="Fig. 7." />
    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one variety of alternation, called <i>two-ranked</i>, which is quite
characteristic of certain trees; that is, the leaves are so flattened
out as to be in one plane on the opposite sides of the twig (<a href="#i018f">Fig. 6</a>).
The Elm-trees form good examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> of two-ranked alternate leaves, while
the Apple leaves are alternate without being two-ranked. Most leaves
spread from the stem, but some are <i>appressed</i>, as in the Arbor-vitæ
(<a href="#i019b">Fig. 7</a>). In this species the <i>branches</i> are <i>two-ranked</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Parts of Leaves.</span>&mdash;A <a href="images/illus019a.png"><i>complete leaf</i></a> consists of three
parts: the <i>blade</i>, the thin expanded portion; the <i>petiole</i>, the
leafstalk; and the <i>stipules</i>, a pair of small blades at the base of the
petiole. The petiole is often very short and sometimes wanting. The
stipules are often absent, and, even when present, they frequently fall
off as soon as the leaves expand; sometimes they are conspicuous. Most
Willows show the stipules on the young luxuriant growths.</p>


<div class="floatl" style="width: 200px;" id="i019c">
    <a href="images/illus019c.png">

        title="Fig. 8." />
    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Veining.</span>&mdash;The leaves of most trees have a distinct framework, the
central line of which is called a <i>midrib</i>; sometimes the leaf has
several other lines about as thick as the midrib, which are called
<i>ribs</i>; the lines next in size, including all that are especially
distinct, are called <i>veins</i>, the most minute ones being called
<i>veinlets</i> (<a href="#i019c">Fig. 8</a>).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Kinds.</span>&mdash;Leaves are <a href="images/illus019d.png"><i>simple</i></a> when they have but one blade;
<i>compound</i> when they have more than one. Compound leaves are <a href="images/illus019e.png"><i>palmate</i></a>
when all the blades come from one point, as in the Horse-chestnut;
<i>pinnate</i> when they are arranged along the sides, as in
the Hickory. Pinnate leaves are of two kinds: <a href="images/illus020a.png"><i>odd-pinnate</i></a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
when there is an odd leaflet at the end, as in the Ash,
and <a href="images/illus020b.png"><i>abruptly pinnate</i></a> when there is no end leaflet.</p>

<p>Many trees have the leaves <i>twice pinnate</i>; they are either <a href="images/illus020c.png"><i>twice
odd-pinnate</i></a> or <a href="images/illus020d.png"><i>twice abruptly pinnate</i></a>.
The separate blades of a compound leaf are called <i>leaflets</i>. Leaves or
leaflets are <i>sessile</i> when they have no stems, and <i>petiolate</i> when
they have stems.</p>

<p>When there are several ribs starting together from the base of a blade,
it is said to be <i>radiate-veined</i> or <a href="images/illus020e.png"><i>palmate-veined</i></a>. When the
great veins all branch from
the midrib, the leaf is <a href="images/illus020f.png"><i>feather-veined</i> or <i>pinnate-veined</i></a>. If these
veins are straight, distinct, and regularly placed, the leaf is said to
be <a href="images/illus020g.png"><i>straight-veined</i></a>. The Chestnut is a
good example. Leaves having veinlets joining each other like a net are
said to be <i>netted-veined</i>. All the trees with broad leaves in the
northern United States, with one exception, have netted-veined foliage.
A leaf having its veinlets parallel to one another is said to be
<a href="images/illus020h.png"><i>parallel-veined</i> or <i>-nerved</i></a>. The Ginkgo-tree, the Indian Corn, and
the Calla Lily have parallel-veined leaves. The narrow
leaves of the cone-bearing trees are also parallel-veined.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Forms.</span>&mdash;Leaves can readily be divided into the three following groups
with regard to their general outline:</p>

<p>1. <i>Broadest at the middle.</i> <a href="images/illus020j.png"><i>Orbicular</i></a>, about as broad
as long and rounded. <a href="images/illus020i.png"><i>Oval</i></a>, about twice as long as wide,
and regularly curved. <a href="images/illus020k.png"><i>Elliptical</i></a>, more than twice as
long as wide, and evenly curved. <a href="images/illus020l.png"><i>Oblong</i></a>, two or three
times as long as wide, with the sides parallel. <a href="images/illus020m.png"><i>Linear</i></a>,
elongated oblong, more than three times as long as wide. <a href="images/illus020n.png"><i>Acerose</i></a>,
needle-shaped, like the leaf of the Pine-tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Broadest near the base.</i> <i><a href="images/illus021a.png">Deltoid</a></i>, broad and
triangular. <a href="images/illus021b.png"><i>Ovate</i></a>, evenly curved, with a broad,
rounded base. <a href="images/illus021c.png"><i>Heart-shaped</i> or <i>cordate</i></a>, similar to
ovate, but with a notch at the base. <a href="images/illus021d.png"><i>Lanceolate</i></a>,
shaped like the head of a lance. <a href="images/illus021e.png"><i>Awl-shaped</i></a>, shaped
like the shoemaker's curved awl. <a href="images/illus021f.png"><i>Scale-shaped</i></a>,
short, rounded, and appressed to the stem. The Arbor-vitæ
has both awl-shaped and scale-shaped leaves.</p>

<p>3. <i>Broadest near the apex.</i> <a href="images/illus021g.png"><i>Obovate</i></a>, same as ovate,
but with the stem at the narrow end. <a href="images/illus021i.png"><i>Obcordate</i></a>, a
reversed heart-shape. <a href="images/illus021h.png"><i>Oblanceolate</i></a>, a reversed
lanceolate. <a href="images/illus021j.png"><i>Wedge-shaped</i> or <i>cuneate</i></a>, having a somewhat square end and straight sides like a wedge.</p>

<p>These words are often united to form compound ones when the form of the
leaf is somewhat intermediate. The term which most nearly suits the
general form is placed at the end; thus <i>lance-ovate</i> indicates a leaf
between lanceolate and ovate, but nearer ovate than lanceolate; while
<i>ovate-lanceolate</i> indicates one nearer lanceolate.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bases.</span>&mdash;Oftentimes leaves are of some general form, but have a peculiar
base, one that would not be expected from the statement of shape. An
ovate leaf which should have a rounded base might have a tapering one;
it would then be described as ovate with a <a href="images/illus021k.png"><i>tapering base</i></a>.
A lanceolate leaf should naturally have a tapering
base, but might have an <a href="images/illus021l.png"><i>abrupt</i></a> one. Many leaves, no
matter what their general form may be, have more or less notched bases;
such bases are called <a href="images/illus021m.png"><i>cordate</i></a>, <i>deeply</i> or
<i>slightly</i>, as the case may be; and if the lobes at base are elongated,
<a href="images/illus021n.png"><i>auriculate</i></a>. If the basal lobes project outward, the
term <a href="images/illus021o.png"><i>halberd-shaped</i></a> is used. Any form of leaf may
have a base more or less <a href="images/illus021p.png"><i>oblique</i></a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Points.</span>&mdash;The points as well as the bases of leaves are often peculiar,
and need to be described by appropriate terms. <a href="images/illus022a.png"><i>Truncate</i></a> indicates an end that is square; <a href="images/illus022b.png"><i>retuse</i></a>, one
with a slight notch; <i>emarginate</i>, one with a decided notch;
<i>obcordate</i>, with a still deeper notch; <a href="images/illus022c.png"><i>obtuse</i></a>,
angular but abrupt; <a href="images/illus022d.png"><i>acute</i></a>, somewhat sharpened;
<a href="images/illus022e.png"><i>acuminate</i></a>, decidedly sharp-pointed;
<a href="images/illus022f.png"><i>bristle-pointed</i> and <i>awned</i></a>, with a bristle-like
tip; <i>spiny-pointed</i>, with the point sharp and stiff (Holly);
<a href="images/illus022g.png"><i>mucronate</i></a>, with a short, abrupt point.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Margins.</span>&mdash;<a href="images/illus022h.png"><i>Entire</i></a>, edge without notches; <a href="images/illus022i.png"><i>repand</i></a>,
slightly wavy; <a href="images/illus022j.png"><i>sinuate</i></a>,
decidedly wavy; <a href="images/illus022k.png"><i>dentate</i></a>, with tooth-like notches;
<a href="images/illus022l.png"><i>serrate</i></a>, with notches like those of a saw;
<a href="images/illus022m.png"><i>crenate</i></a>, with the teeth rounded; <a href="images/illus022n.png"><i>twice serrate</i></a>,
when there are coarse serrations finely serrated, as
on most Birch leaves; <i>serrulate</i>, with minute serrations; <i>crenulate</i>,
with minute crenations. Leaves can be <i>twice crenate</i> or
<i>sinuate-crenate</i>. <i>Revolute</i> indicates that the edges are rolled over.</p>

<p>When a leaf has a few great teeth, the projecting parts are called
<i>lobes</i>, and the general form of the leaf is what it would be with the
notches filled in. In the description of such leaves, certain terms are
needed in describing the plan of the notches, and their depth and form.</p>

<p>Leaves with palmate veining are <a href="images/illus022o.png"><i>palmately lobed</i></a> or
<i>notched</i>; those with pinnate veining are <a href="images/illus022p.png"><i>pinnately lobed</i></a>
or <i>notched</i>. While the term <i>lobe</i> is applied to all
great teeth of a leaf, whether rounded or pointed, long or short, still
there are four terms sometimes used having special signification with
reference to the depth of the notches. <i>Lobed</i> indicates that the
notches extend about one fourth the distance to the base or midrib;
<i>cleft</i>, that they extend one half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> way; <i>parted</i>, about three
fourths of the way; and <i>divided</i>, that the notches are nearly deep
enough to make a compound leaf of separate leaflets.</p>

<p>So leaves may be palmately lobed, cleft, parted or divided, and
pinnately lobed, cleft, parted or divided. The term <a href="images/illus023.png"><i>pinnatifid</i></a>
is often applied to pinnately cleft leaves. The terms
<i>entire</i>, <i>serrate</i>, <i>crenate</i>, <i>acute-pointed</i>, etc., are applied to
the lobes as well as to the general margins of leaves.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Surface.</span>&mdash;The following terms are needed in describing the surface of
leaves and fruit.</p>

<p><i>Glabrous</i>, smooth; <i>glaucous</i>, covered with a whitish bloom which can
be rubbed off (Plum); <i>rugous</i>, wrinkled; <i>canescent</i>, so covered with
minute hairs as to appear silvery; <i>pubescent</i>, covered with fine, soft,
plainly seen hairs; <i>tomentose</i>, densely covered with matted hairs;
<i>hairy</i>, having longer hairs; <i>scabrous</i>, covered with stiff, scratching
points; <i>spiny</i>, having stiff, sharp spines; <i>glandular-hairy</i>, having
the hairs ending in glands (usually needing a magnifying glass to be
seen).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Texture.</span>&mdash;<i>Succulent</i>, fleshy; <i>scarious</i>, dry and chaffy; <i>punctate</i>,
having translucent glands, so that the leaf appears, when held toward
the light, as though full of holes; <i>membranous</i>, thin, soft, and rather
translucent; <i>thick</i>, <i>thin</i>, etc.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Duration.</span>&mdash;<i>Evergreen</i>, hanging on the tree from year to year. By
noticing the color of the different leaves and their position on the
twigs, all evergreen foliage can readily be determined at any time
during the year. <i>Deciduous</i>, falling off at the end of the season.
<i>Fugacious</i>, falling early, as the stipules of many leaves.</p>

<i>Flowers and Fruit.</i></h3>


<p>The author hopes that those who use this work in studying trees will
become so much interested in the subject of Botany as to desire more
information concerning the growth and reproduction of plants than can
here be given. In Professor Asa Gray's numerous works the additional
information desired may be obtained: "How Plants Grow" contains an
outline for the use of beginners; "The Elements of Botany" is a more
advanced work; while the "Botanical Text Book", in several volumes, will
enable the student to pursue the subject as far as he may wish. In this
small book the barest outline of the parts of flowers and fruit and of
their uses can be given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flowers.</span>&mdash;Parts. The flowers of the Cherry or Apple will show the four
kinds of organs that belong to a complete flower. <a href="#i024a">Fig. 9</a> represents an
Apple-blossom. The <i>calyx</i> is the outer row of leaves, more or less
united into one piece. The <i>corolla</i> is the row of leaves within the
calyx; it is usually the brightest and most conspicuous part of the
flower. The <a href="images/illus024b.png"><i>stamens</i></a> are the next organs; they are
usually, as in this case, small two-lobed bodies on slender, thread-like
stalks. The enlarged parts contain a dust-like material called
<i>pollen</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> The last of the four kinds of parts is found in the center of
the flower, and is called the <i>pistil</i>. It is this part which forms the
fruit and incloses the seed.</p>

<p>The stamens and the pistil are the <i>essential</i> organs of a flower,
because they, and they only, are needed in the formation of seeds. The
pollen from the stamen, acting on the pistil, causes the <i>ovules</i> which
are in the pistil to grow into <i>seeds</i>.</p>

<p>The calyx and corolla are called <i>enveloping organs</i>, since they
surround and protect the essential parts.</p>

<p>The pieces of which the calyx is composed are called <i>sepals</i>. The
Apple-blossom has five sepals.</p>

<p>The pieces that compose the corolla are called <i>petals</i>.</p>


<div class="floatr" style="width: 200px;" id="i025">

    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 10.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kinds of Flowers.</span>&mdash;When the petals are entirely separate from each
other, as in the Apple-blossom, the flower is said to be <i>polypetalous</i>;
when they grow together more or less, as in the Catalpa (<a href="#i025">Fig. 10</a>),
<i>monopetalous</i>; and when the corolla is wanting, as in the flowers of
the Oak, <i>apetalous</i>.</p>

<p>When all sides of a flower are alike, as in the Apple-blossom, the
flower is <i>regular</i>; when one side of the corolla differs from the other
in color, form, or size, as in the Common Locust, or Catalpa, the flower
is <i>irregular</i>.</p>

<p>In trees the stamens and pistils are often found in separate flowers; in
that case the blossoms containing stamens are called <i>staminate</i>, and
those containing pistils <i>pistillate</i>; those that contain both are
called <i>perfect</i>. Staminate and pistillate flowers are usually found on
the same tree, as in the Oaks, Birches, Chestnut, etc.; in that case the
plant is said to be <i>mon&oelig;cious</i>, and all trees of this kind produce
fruit. Sometimes, however, the staminate and pistillate flowers are on
separate trees, as in the Willows, which are <i>di&oelig;cious</i>; and then
only a portion of the trees&mdash;those with pistillate flowers&mdash;produce
fruit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Arrangement of Flowers.</span>&mdash;Flowers, either solitary or clustered, grow in
one of two ways; either at the end of the branches, being then called
<i>terminal</i>, or in the axils of the leaves, then called <i>axillary</i>. The
stem of a solitary flower or the main stem of a cluster is called a
<i>peduncle</i>; the stems of the separate blossoms of a cluster are called
<i>pedicels</i>. When either the flowers or the clusters are without stems,

there will be no rigorous adherence to an exact classification; no
attempt made to distinguish between fruits formed from a simple pistil
and those from a compound one; nor generally between those formed from a
single and those formed from a cluster of flowers. The fruit and its
general classification, determined by the parts easily seen, is all that
will be attempted.</p>

<p>As stated before, it is hoped that this volume will not end the
student's work in the investigation of natural objects, but that the
amount of information here given will lead to the desire for much more.</p>

<p><i>Berry</i> will be the term applied to all fleshy fruits with more than one
seed buried in the mass. Persimmon, Mulberry, Holly. The <i>pome</i> or
<i>Apple-pome</i> differs from the berry in the fact that the seeds are
situated in cells formed of hardened material. Apple, Mountain-ash. The
<i>Plum</i> or <i>Cherry drupe</i> includes all fleshy fruits with a single
stony-coated part, even if it contains more than one seed. Peach,
Viburnum, China-tree. In some cases, when there is but one seed in the
flesh and that not stony-coated, it will be called a <i>drupe-like berry</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>dry drupe</i> is like the Cherry drupe except that the flesh is much
harder. The fruit of the Walnut, Hickory, and Sumac.</p>

<i>Winter Study of Trees.</i></h3>


<p>Many of the peculiarities of trees can be studied much better during the
winter and early spring than at any other time of the year. The plan of
branching, the position, number, size, form, color, and surface of buds,
as well as the arrangement of the leaves within the bud and the
peculiarities of the scales that cover them, are points for winter
investigation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">General Plan of Branching.</span>&mdash;There are two distinct and readily
recognized systems of branching. 1. The main stem is <i>excurrent</i> (<a href="#i014">Fig.
3</a>) when the trunk extends as an undivided stem throughout the tree to
the tip; this causes the spire-like or conical trees so common among
narrow-leaved evergreens. 2. The main stem is <i>deliquescent</i> (<a href="#i015">Fig. 4</a>)
when the trunk divides into many, more or less equal divisions, forming
the broad-topped, spreading trees. This plan is the usual one among
deciduous trees. A few species, however, such as the Sweet Gum and the
Sugar-maple, show the excurrent stem while young, yet even these have a
deliquescent stem later in life. The English Maple and the Apple both
have a deliquescent stem very early.</p>

<p>All the narrow-leaved evergreens, and many of the broad-leaved trees as
well, show what is called <i>definite</i> annual growths; that is, a certain
amount of leaf and stem, packed up in the winter bud, spreads out and
hardens with woody tissue early in the year, and then, no matter how
long the season remains warm, no additional leaves or stem will grow.
The buds for the next year's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> growth then form and often become quite
large before autumn.</p>

<p>There are many examples among the smaller plants, but rarely one among
the trees, of <i>indefinite</i> annual growth; that is, the plant puts forth
leaves and forms stems throughout the whole growing-season. The common
Locust, the Honey-locust, and the Sumacs are illustrations.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Buds.</span>&mdash;Buds are either undeveloped branches or undeveloped flowers. They
contain within the scales, which usually cover them, closely packed
leaves; these leaves are folded and wrinkled in a number of different
ways that will be defined at the end of this chapter.</p>


<div class="floatl" style="width: 100px;" id="i030">
    <a href="images/illus030.jpg">
    <img src="images/illus030s.jpg"
        width="58" height="300"
        alt="Fig. 14."
        title="Fig. 14." />
    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Position and Number.</span>&mdash;While the axils of the leaves and the ends of the
stems are the ordinary places for the buds, there are many peculiarities
in regard to their exact position, number, etc., that render them very
interesting for winter study. Sometimes there are several to the single
leaf. In the Silver Maple there are buds on each side of the true
axillary one; these are flower-buds, and during the winter they are
larger than the one which produces the branch. The Butternut (<a href="#i030">Fig. 14</a>)
and the Walnut have several above each other, the upper one being the
largest and at quite a distance from the true axil. In these cases the
uppermost is apt to grow, and then the branch is said to be
<i>extra-axillary</i>. In the Sycamore the bud does not show while the leaf
remains on the tree, as it is in the hollow of the leafstalk. In the
winter the bud has a ring-like scar entirely around it, instead of the
moon-shaped scar below as in most trees. The Common Locust has several
buds under the leafstalk and one above it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> the axil. This axillary
bud may grow during the time the leaf remains on the tree, and afterward
the growth of the strongest one of the others may give the tree two
branches almost together.</p>

<p>Some plants form extra buds especially when they are bruised or injured;
those which have the greatest tendency to do so are the Willows,
Poplars, and Elms. Such buds and growths are called <i>adventitious</i>. By
cutting off the tops or <i>pollarding</i> such trees, a very great number of
adventitious branches can be made to grow. In this way the Willow-twigs
used for baskets are formed. Adventitious buds form the clusters of
curious thorns on the Honey-locust and the tufts of whip-like branches
on the trunks and large limbs of the Elms.</p>

<p>In trees the terminal bud and certain axillary ones, differing according
to the species or variety of tree, are, during the winter, much larger
than the rest. These are the ones which naturally form the new growth,
and upon their arrangement the character of branching and thus the form
of the tree depend. Each species has some peculiarity in this regard,
and thus there are differences in the branching of all trees. In
opposite-leaved plants the terminal bud may be small and weak, while the
two buds at its side may be strong and apt to grow. This causes a
forking of the branches each year. This plan is not rare among shrubs,
the Lilac being a good example.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bud-Scales.</span>&mdash;The coverings of buds are exceedingly varied, and are well
worthy of study and investigation. The large terminal buds of the
Horse-chestnut, with their numerous scales, gummy on the outside to keep
out the dampness, and hairy within to protect them from sudden changes
of temperature, represent one extreme of a long line; while the small,
naked, and partly buried buds of the Honey-locust or the Sumac represent
the other end.</p>

<p>The scales of many buds are merely extra parts formed for their
protection, and fall immediately after the burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ing of the buds; while
other buds have the stipules of the leaves as bud-scales; these remain
on the twigs for a time in the Tulip-tree, and drop immediately in the
Magnolia.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Forms of Buds.</span>&mdash;The size of buds varies greatly, as before stated, but
this difference in size is no more marked than the difference in form.
There is no better way to recognize a Beech at any time of the year than
by its very long, slender, and sharp-pointed buds. The obovate and
almost stalked buds of the Alders are also very conspicuous and
peculiar. In the Balsam Poplar the buds are large, sharp-pointed, and
gummy; in the Ailanthus they cannot be seen.</p>

    </a>
   <p class="caption">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>All the things that might be learned from a small winter twig cannot be
shown in an engraving, but the figures here given illustrate some of the
facts easily determined from such specimens. The first twig (Ash) had
opposite leaves and is 3 years old (the end of each year's growth is
marked by dotted lines on all the figures); the year before last it had
6 leaves on the middle portion; last year it had 8 leaves on the end
portion and 12 on the side shoots of the middle portion. The buds near
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> end of the annual growth are strongest and are most apt to grow.
The specimen illustrated was probably taken from the end of a branch of
a rather young and luxuriantly growing tree. Thus the Ash must have
quite a regular growth and form a regularly outlined tree.</p>

<p>The second twig (Sweet Gum) shows 7 years' growth and is probably a side
shoot from more or less within the tree-top. It is stunted in its growth
by the want of light and room. The leaves were alternate.</p>

<p>The third twig (Sycamore) also had alternate leaves; the pointed buds
must have been under the leafstalks, as the leaf-scars show as rings
around the buds. The larger branch grew three years ago. From the
specimen one judges that the Sycamore is quite an irregularly formed
tree. The twig had 11 leaves last year.</p>

<p>The fourth twig (Silver Maple) shows that the plant had opposite leaves,
and supernumerary buds at the sides of the true axillary ones; the true
axillary buds are smaller than those at the sides. It would, in such
cases, be reasonable to suppose that the supernumerary buds were floral
ones, and that the plant blooms before the leaves expand. The annual
growths are quite extended; two years and a part of the third make up
the entire twig. If it was cut during the winter of 1891-92, it must
have had leaves on the lower part in 1889 and 12 leaves on the middle
portion in 1890, as well as probably 4 on the lower portion on the side
shoots. Last year it had 14 leaves on the end portion, two at least on
each side shoot below, making 24 in all.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Folding of Leaves in the Bud.</i></p>

<p>There are some peculiarities in the arrangement of leaves in the bud
which can be investigated only in the early spring. The common plans
among trees are&mdash;<i>Inflexed</i>: blade folded crosswise, thus bringing it
upon the footstalk. Tulip-tree. <i>Conduplicate</i>: blade folded along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the
midrib, bringing the two halves together. Peach. <i>Plicate</i>: folded
several times lengthwise, like a fan. Birch. <i>Convolute</i>: rolled
edgewise from one edge to the other. Plum. <i>Involute</i>: both edges rolled
in toward the midrib on the upper side. Apple. <i>Revolute</i>: both edges
rolled backward. Willow. <i>Obvolute</i>: folded together, but the opposite
leaves half inclosing each other. Dogwood.</p>

<p>Three specimens are needed of each kind of tree: one, a branch showing
the flowers; another, showing the fruit&mdash;one of these, and in many cases
both, will show the leaves. The third specimen, cut from a large limb or
trunk, shows the bark and the wood. This should be a specimen with a
surface so cut as to show the wood in the direction of the silver grain,
<i>radial section</i>; with another surface cut in the direction of the
annual layers, <i>tangential section</i>; and with a third cut across the
grain, <i>cross-section</i>. It should be a specimen old enough to show the
change of color in the heart-wood. By taking a limb or trunk 8 inches in
diameter, all these points can be secured. A specimen cut as shown in
the figure will illustrate all the desired points. Side E F G shows
sap-and heart-wood in tangential section; side A B D C shows the same in
radial section; end A B F E, in cross-section;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> and B F G D shows the
bark. The central pith is at I; the heart-wood extends from C to J; the
sap-wood from J to D. The silver grain is well shown at the end, and the
blotches formed by it on the radial section.</p>

<p>By having the piece made smooth, and the upper part down to the center
(H) varnished, the appearance of the wood in furniture or inside finish
will be illustrated.</p>

<p>The specimens should be as nearly uniform in size as possible. If a limb
8 inches in diameter be taken and a length of 6 inches be cut off, the
section A B D C should pass through the line of pith; the section E F G
should be parallel with this at a distance from it of two inches; and
two inches from the line of pith, the section A E C should be made. The
whole specimen will then be 6 inches wide and long, and 2 inches thick.</p>

<p>The twigs containing leaves, flowers and fruit need to be pressed while
drying in order that they may be kept in good form and made tough enough
to be retained as specimens. The plants should be placed between a large
supply of newspapers, or, better still, untarred building-felt, while
drying. A weight of from 40 to 80 pounds is needed to produce the
requisite pressure. The weight is placed upon a board covering the pile
of plants and paper. On account of the size of many leaves and
flower-clusters, these pressed specimens of trees should not be shorter
than from 12 to 15 inches, and even a length of 18 inches is an
advantage. The pads or newspapers should be about 12 by 18 inches. A
transfer of the plants into dry pads each day for a few days will hasten
the drying and increase the beauty of the specimens. The specimens of
twigs can be mounted on cardboard by being partly pasted and partly
secured by narrow strips of gummed cloth placed across the heavier
portions. The cardboard should be uniform in size. One of the regular
sizes of Bristol-board is 22 by 28 inches; this will cut into four
pieces 11 by 14. Specimens not over 15 inches in length can readily be
mounted on these, and for most collectors this might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> a very
convenient size. Another regular size is 22 by 32 inches, cutting well
into pieces 11 by 16. Specimens 15 to 18 inches long can be mounted on
these.</p>

<p>Some kinds of Evergreens, the Spruces especially, tend to shed their
leaves after pressing. Such kinds can in most cases be made to form good
specimens without pressing. Fasten the fresh specimens on pillars of
plaster in boxes or frames 2 to 3 inches deep, so that they touch
nothing but the column of plaster. Mix calcined plaster in water (as
plasterers do), and build up a column high enough to support the branch.
Place the specimen on the top of the pillar already formed, and pour
over the whole some quite thin plaster till a rounded top is formed
completely fastening the specimen. If the leaves are not touched at all,
after they are dry, they will hang on for a long time, making specimens
that will show the tree characteristics better than pressed specimens
possibly could.</p>

PLAN AND MODELS FOR TREE DESCRIPTION</h2>


<p>All pupils should be required to write some form of composition on the
trees of the region. As far as possible, these compositions should be
the result of personal investigation. It is not what a pupil can read
and redescribe in more or less his own words, but how accurately he can
see and, from the information conveyed by his own senses, describe in
his own way the things he has observed, that makes the use of such a
book as this important as an educational aid. Some information in regard
to trees, in a finished description, must be obtained from books, such
as hardiness, geographical distribution, etc. Pupils generally should be
required to include only those things which they can give from actual
observation.</p>

<p>There are four distinct forms of tree descriptions that might be
recognized by the teacher and occasionally called for as work from the
pupil. 1st. A bare skeleton description, written by aid of a topical
outline, from the observation of a single tree and its parts. 2d. A
connected description, conveying as many facts given in the outline as
can well be brought into good English sentences. This again is the
description of a single tree. 3d. A connected, readable description of a
certain kind of tree, made up from the observation of many trees of the
same species to be found in the neighborhood. 4th. The third description
including information to be obtained from outside sources in regard to
the origin, geographical distribution, hardiness, character of wood,
habits, durability, etc. These four plans of description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> are more or
less successive methods to be introduced as the work of a class. Pupils
should be induced to carry on their own investigations as far as
possible before going to printed sources for information. A good part of
class work should be devoted to the first three of the methods given,
but the work might finally include the fourth form of composition. The
first two methods should follow each other with each of the trees
studied; that is, one week let a mere outline be written, to be followed
the next week with as clear and connected a description as the ability
of the pupil will allow, and containing as much of the information given
in the outline as possible.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Outline for Tree Description.</span></p>

<p><i>The tree as a whole</i>: size, general form, trunk, branching, twigs,
character of bark, color of bark on trunk, branches, and fine spray.</p>

<p><i>Leaves</i>: parts, arrangement, kinds, size, thickness, form, edges,
veining, color, surface, duration.</p>

<p><i>Buds</i>: position, size, form, covering, number, color.</p>

<p><i>Sap</i> and <i>juice</i>.</p>

<p><i>Flowers</i>: size, shape, color, parts, odor, position, time of blooming,
duration.</p>

<p><i>Fruit</i>: size, kind, form, color when young and when ripe, time of
ripening, substance, seeds, duration, usefulness.</p>

<p><i>Wood</i> (often necessarily omitted): hardness, weight, color, grain,
markings, durability.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>: the peculiarities not brought out by the above outline.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Notes on the Foregoing Outline.</span></p>

<p>The height of a tree can be readily determined by the following plan.
Measure the height you can easily reach from the ground in feet and
inches. Step to the trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> of the tree you wish to measure and, reaching
up to this height, pin a piece of white paper on the tree. Step back a
distance equal to three or four times the height of the tree; hold a
lead-pencil upright between the thumb and forefinger at arm's-length.
Fix it so that the end of the pencil shall be in line with the paper on
the trunk; move the thumb down the pencil till it is in line with the
ground at the base of the tree; move the arm and pencil upward till the
thumb is in line with the paper, and note where the end of the pencil
comes on the tree. Again move the pencil till the thumb is in line with
the new position, and so continue the process till the top of the tree
is reached. The number of the measures multiplied by the height you can
reach will give quite accurately the height of the tree.</p>

<p>The width of the tree can be determined in the same manner, the pencil,
however, being held horizontally.</p>

<p>In giving the forms of trees, it is well to accompany the description
with a penciled outline.</p>

<p>The distance from the ground at which the trunk begins to branch and the
extent of the branching should be noted. The direction taken by the
branches, as well as the regularity and the irregularity of their
position, should also be observed and described.</p>

<p>Although most twigs are cylindrical, still there are enough exceptions
to make it necessary to examine them with reference to their form.</p>

<p>Under leaves, it will be well to make drawings, both of the outline and
of the veining.</p>

<p>Crushed leaves will give the odor, and the sap can best be noticed at
the bases of young leaves. The differences in sap and juice need the
following words for their description: <i>watery</i>, <i>milky</i>,
<i>mucilaginous</i>, <i>aromatic</i>, <i>spicy</i>, <i>sweet</i>, <i>gummy</i>, <i>resinous</i>.</p>

<p>Pupils should not always be expected to find out much about the flowers
of a tree, as they are frequently very evanescent, and usually difficult
to reach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The fruit lasts a greater length of time and, usually dropping
spontaneously, gives a much better chance for investigation.</p>

<p>Specimens of most of the common woods may be obtained from
cabinet-makers and carpenters. In cases where these specimens are at
hand, description of the wood should be required. If the school has such
specimens as are described in Chapter VI., Part I., the wood in all its
peculiarities can be described.</p>

<p>Tree eighty-four feet tall, thirty feet wide near base, ovate, conical,
pointed; trunk seven feet in circumference near base and ridged
lengthwise, but only four feet at the height of six feet from the
ground, where it becomes round or nearly so, then gradually tapering to
the top; branches small, very numerous, beginning six feet from the
ground, sloping upward from the trunk at an angle of nearly forty-five
degrees; twigs very slender, numerous, pendulous, two, three or even
more growing together from supernumerary buds around the old scars; bark
brownish, quite rough, thick and soft on the trunk, smoother on the
branches, greenish on the young spray.</p>

<p>Leaves about sessile, without stipules, alternate, crowded, two-ranked,
thin, linear, entire, parallel-veined, with midrib, dark green, smooth,
deciduous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Buds show in the axils of only a few of the leaves, and are very small;
but there are several supernumerary buds around many of the clusters of
the shoots of the year.</p>

<p>Sap clear and slightly sticky with resin.</p>

</div>

<p>Flowers looked for, but not seen; must have been small, or have bloomed
before my examination in the spring.</p>

<p>Fruit one inch in diameter, cone globular, brown in the autumn; did not
notice it before; fifteen six-sided scales, two seeds under each, still
hanging on, though the leaves have dropped; only to produce seeds, I
think.</p>

<p>The wood I do not know about.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i> Around the base, at some distance from the trunk, there are
four peculiar knobs, seemingly coming from the roots, one being nearly a
foot high and nine inches through.</p>


<p class="center"><i>No. 2.</i></p>

<p>The Bald Cypress standing near a small ditch in Atterbury's meadow is a
very beautiful, tall, conical tree, over 80 feet high, with an excurrent
trunk which is very large and ridged near the ground. It tapers rapidly
upward, so that the circumference is only about half as great at the
height of 6 feet, where the branches begin. The branches are very
numerous and, considering the size of the trunk, very small; the largest
of them being only about 2 inches through. They all slope upward
rapidly, but the tip and fine spray show a tendency to droop; the fine
thread-like branchlets, bearing the leaves of the year, are almost all
pendulous.</p>

<p>The bark is very rough, thick and soft, as I found in pinning on the bit
of paper to measure the height of the tree, when I could easily press
the pin in to its head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The leaves are very small and delicate, and as they extend out in two
ranks from the thread-like twigs, look much like fine ferns. The small
linear leaves and the spray drop off together in the autumn, as I can
find much of last year's foliage on the ground still fastened to the
twigs. I could not see any flowers, though I looked from early in the
spring till the middle of the summer; then I saw a few of the globular
green cones, almost an inch in diameter, showing that it had bloomed.
Next spring I shall begin to look for the blossoms before the leaves
come out.</p>

<p>On the ground, about 6 feet from the tree, there are four very strange
knobs which I did not notice till I stumbled over one of them. They seem
to grow from the roots, and are quite soft and reddish in color.</p>


<p class="center"><i>No. 3.</i></p>

<p>I have found twenty-two Bald Cypresses in Trenton; they are all
beautiful conical trees, and seem to grow well in almost any soil, as I
have found some in very wet places and some in dry, sandy soil. They
look from their position as though they had been planted out, and as I
have found none in the woods around the town, they are probably not
native in this region. They are from 50 to nearly 100 feet tall. I found
one 96 feet high. They are all of a very symmetrical, conical form, and
pointed at the top; in no case has the trunk divided into branches, and
on the old trees the trunk enlarges curiously near the ground, the lower
portion being very rough with ridges. The bark is very thick and rough,
and is so soft that a pin can readily be pushed through it to the wood.
The branches are very numerous and small, and are not regularly arranged
in whorls like most of the narrow-leaved trees. These branches all slope
upward from the trunk, the ends having a tendency to bend downward and
make delicate drooping spray, with very small, linear, entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> leaves
only ½ inch long. Four of the largest trees show fruit, and each of
these has only about a half-dozen of the globular cones. Only a few of
the trees&mdash;those in the wettest places&mdash;have the knobs on the ground
near the base.</p>


<p class="center"><i>No. 4.</i></p>

<p>The Bald Cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>) is a common tree, a native of
the Gulf States, growing very abundantly in the wettest swamps of that
region. The northern limit of the tree in its wild state is said to be
central Delaware and southern Illinois, but it can be successfully
cultivated in the region around Boston. There are several named
varieties, one with the leaves but slightly spreading from the spray,
and the whole of the branches showing a decided weeping tendency, so
that it is called the Weeping Cypress. The knobs from the roots, called
Cypress-knees, grow very abundantly around all the trees in the southern
swamps. These grow to the height of from 2 to 4 feet, and are very
thick, sometimes as much as 5 feet. They are hollow, and are
occasionally used for bee-hives.</p>

<p>It is said to be a broad, flat-topped tree, spreading its top over other
trees. This seems very strange, as none of those in Trenton, N. J., show
such a tendency, but are quite spire-shaped. The wood is light, soft,
straight-grained, and is said to be excellent for shingles and for other
purposes. It generally has a dark reddish or brownish hue. It is a large
tree, growing to the height of 140 feet. The trunk is sometimes 12 feet
through near the ground. The flowers of the tree are in small catkins,
blooming before the leaves expand in the early spring; in February, in
South Carolina.</p>

KEY, CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Method of Using the Key.</i></p>

<p>First read <i>all</i> the statements following the stars (*) at the beginning
of the Key; decide which one of the statements best suits the specimen
you have. At the end of the chosen one there is a letter in parenthesis
( ). Somewhere below, this letter is used two or more times. Read
carefully <i>all</i> the statements following this letter; at the end of the
one which most nearly states the facts about your specimen, you will
again be directed by a letter to another part of the Key. Continue this
process till, instead of a letter, there is a number and name. The name
is that of the genus, and forms the first part of the scientific name of
the plant. Turn to the descriptive part of the book, where this number,
in regular order, is found. Here descriptions of the species of the
genus are given. If there are many species, another Key will lead to the
species. While the illustrations are intended to represent
characteristic specimens, too much dependence must not be placed upon
them; the leaves even of the same plant vary considerably, and the
different varieties, especially of a cultivated plant, vary widely. Read
the whole description before deciding.</p>

<p>The fractions beside the figures indicate the scale of the drawing as
compared with the natural size of the part: 1/1 indicates natural size;
2/1, that the drawing is twice the length of the object; ¼, that the
drawing is one fourth the length of the object, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>In the description of leaves the dimensions given refer to the blade.</p>

<p>Large trees to shrubs, with simple, alternate, deciduous or evergreen,
entire to deeply lobed leaves. The leaves are rather thick and woody,
and remain on the tree either all winter or at least until nearly all
other deciduous leaves have fallen. Flowers insignificant; the staminate
ones in catkins; blooming in spring. Fruit an acorn, which in the White,
Chestnut, and Live Oaks matures the same year the blossoms appear; while
in the Red, Black, and Willow Oaks the acorns mature the second year.
They remain on the tree until late in autumn. The Oaks, because of their
large tap-roots, can be transplanted only when small. Most of the
species are in cultivation. The species are very closely related, and a
number of them quite readily hybridize; this is especially true of those
of a particular group, as the White Oaks, Black Oaks, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no attempt in the Key to characterize the hybrids, of which
some are quite extensively distributed. <i>Quercus heterophylla</i>, Michx.
(Bartram's Oak), supposed to be a hybrid between <i>Quercus Phellos</i> and
<i>Quercus rubra</i>, is found quite frequently from Staten Island southward
to North Carolina.</p>

Stipules often large, leaf-like, and more or less persistent through the
summer; sometimes scale-like and dropping early. The stipules are always
free from the leafstalk and attached to the twig at small spots just
below the leafstalk. Even if the stipules have dropped off, the small
scars remain. Flowers staminate and pistillate on separate trees
(di&oelig;cious), in elongated catkins in early spring. Fruit consists of
catkins of small pods with numerous seeds having silky down at one end.
The seeds usually drop early. Among the Willows there are so many
hybrids and peculiar varieties as to render their study difficult, and
their classification, in some cases, impossible. The following Key will
probably enable the student to determine most specimens. No attempt has
